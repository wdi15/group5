          <P> There are millions of kids around the world that don't have access to a proper education or a school. However, with your help, we can change that. This website tells you all about the charities and our cause which is worldwide education. By the way, I like cheese. <P>

        <h1> REASONS TO GET INVOLVED </h1>
        <h3> Here Are the Facts </h3>

        <p>
          <ol>
            <li> Around 115 million primary school age children do not go to school. </li>
            <li> In developing nations, each additional year of schooling can improve a person's prospective earnings by an average of 10 percent. </li>
            <li> Public school is not free in most third-world countries. The students' families are expected to pay for the cost of books, school uniforms and teachers' salaries. </li>
            <li> In certain areas of Africa, the literacy rates for children 18 and under are less than 50 percent.</li>
            <li> Educated girls and women are more capable of giving birth to healthier children since education and awareness helps to reduce the spread of infectious diseases, such as HIV and AIDS, which can be passed from mother to child during childbirth. </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p> We all know that education is important. That is why there are many organizations dedicated to building schools and educating teachers all around the world. However, there are still many children in poverty or in third world countries, or even in slums in first world countries who don't have access to proper schooling. However, with your help, we can change that. Access to education was one of the millenium goals that were set by the UN. These mellenium goals have a deadline of 2015, which is this year. However, we are far from reaching the goal. We still have much to do, and you can help too.</p>

          <p> There are many non-profit organizations out there that help children all over the world have access to education. One of these organizations is <span> Education without borders (EwB) </span>, which is a Canadian non-profit organization. This organization helps with providing schooling for people in places where everything isn't just ponies and rainbows. They do this through their tutoring programs and by focusing on one school at a time. One of these programs include the "math yes we can" tutoring program which enables students to learn highschool math, and has been very successful in fostering interest of learning in children of South Africa.  </p>

          <p> Some charities have bigger areas of interest like the organization called <span>Concern Worldwide</span>. Concern Worldwide is an organization based in Europe that has been working towards this cause for more than 30 years. Even though their main aim is to provide secure access to education to children worldwide, they also do many things to ensure the safety and well-being of children. They have worked in many countries including Ethiopia, Malawi, Bangladesh, Kenya and Sierra Leone. They also specially focus on the education of girls and women. Not only is this group working to educate teachers and build schools, they also work with the local governments of some of the poorest countries in the world to challenge inequality, and remove barriers that prevent children from learning. </p>
